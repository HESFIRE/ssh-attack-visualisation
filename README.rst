**The code in this repo is by no means pretty or Pythonic.**

**I took an article that is linked below and re-used it, adding my own modifications
for my own purposes and also to massively improve the speed.**

**The shell files are my own and were written by me, but again they are
for pure ease of use.**

**Everything in this repo is custom-made for a specific purpose, it is unlikely to be
of any use to you.**
