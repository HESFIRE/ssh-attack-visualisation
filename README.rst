**The code in this repo is by no means pretty or Pythonic.

I took an article that is linked above and re-used it, adding my own modifications
for my own purposes and also to massively improve the speed.

The shell files are my own and were written by me, but again they are
for pure ease of use **

**Everything in this repo is custom-made for a specific purpose, it is unlikely to be
of any use to you**
